# Registration
At front-end side I created a form which contains three fields which are user name, password and email.
One loader also added.
Used MaterializedCSS for designing and added jquery.
Created "user" table in "youtube" database in MySQL database at local server.
Created JDBC connection and Successfully inserted data(user name, password and email) in database.
Successfully implemented ajax using jquery.
The main purpose of using ajax is instead of reloading whole web page when submiting form data only one request has to be sent to servlet and it does processing at backend and gives us result as successful or not.
Done with final validations too.
